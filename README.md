This is a 2D first-person-view Dungeon Crawler prototype made in [AGS engine](https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/).
Requires AGS 4.0 ([get here](https://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/forums/ags-engine-editor-releases/ags-4-0-early-alpha-for-public-test/)), because it needs the new script compiler and engine features related to extended managed objects handling.

Work in progress in a draft state, with no far goals, currently is being created purely for self-enjoyment and education.

Little art is used, most of the level gfx at the moment is generated using colored triangles (quads).
